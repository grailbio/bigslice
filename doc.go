	Package bigslice implements a distributed data processing system.
	Users compose computations by operating over large collections ("big
	slices") of data, transforming them with a handful of combinators.
	While users express computations using collections-style operations,
	bigslice takes care of the details of parallel execution and
	distribution across multiple machines.

	Bigslice jobs can run locally, but uses bigmachine for distribution
	among a cluster of compute nodes. In either case, user code does not
	change; the details of distribution are handled by the combination
	of bigmachine and bigslice.

	Because Go cannot easily serialize code to be sent over the wire and
	executed remotely, bigslice programs have to be written with a few
	constraints:

		1. All slices must be constructed by bigslice funcs (bigslice.Func),
		   and all such functions must be instantiated before
		   bigslice.Start is called. This rule is easy to follow: if funcs
		   are global variables, and bigslice.Start is called from a
		   program's main, then the program is compliant.
		2. The driver program must be compiled on the same GOOS and GOARCH
		   as the target architecture. When running locally, this is not a
		   concern, but programs that require distribution must be run from
		   a linux/amd64 binary.

	Some Bigslice operations may be annotated with runtime pragmas:
	directives for the Bigslice runtime. See Pragma for details.
